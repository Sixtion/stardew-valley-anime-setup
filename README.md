# stardew-valley-anime-setup
Do you think that Stardew valley needs more anime? You don't? Well in this guide I'll show you how make you game even MORE ANIME! In addition I'll suggest some nice features you might want in your game if you haven't installed them already.

First things first mods for Stardew Valley in this guide require you to download mods from nexusmods.com so you'll need an account setup first.

Also all mods in this guide will be client-sided and therefore multiplayer compatible.

First things first you need to install SMAPI, a mod-loading API for Stardew Valley mods. You'll need this before you start downloading mods. [You can register here](https://users.nexusmods.com/register).

# Installing SMAPI   ![SMAPI CHICKEN](https://smapi.io/Content/images/pufferchick.png)
1. Download the latest available version that matches your version of Stardew Valley of SMAPI from the [SMAPI website](https://smapi.io/) or the [SMAPI mod page on Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400).
2. When you download the mod you will get a zip file named SMAPI-'version'-installer.zip
3. Unzip the file anywhere and run the SMAPI installer that matches your operating system.
4. You'll be prompted to give the directory to the folder containing your game executable
5. Follow its prompts to properly install SMAPI
   - Notice that the installer automatically installs 3 bundled mods. Console Commands, Error Handler, and Save Backup.
6. Once its installed it will give you a line that you can add to you game launch settings on Steam.
7. You can choose to add this to you launch settings if you want Steam to automatically launch the modded 
   - To do this right-click your game in your Steam library or click the cogwheel on the right of the game page and select properties.
   - In the general tab at the bottom there should be a section called launch options and there you can post the line that SMAPI gave us in its console. Make sure it leads to an .exe and not just the folder tht it is in. e.g. 
    <pre><code>"C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\StardewModdingAPI.exe" %command%</pre></code>
   
8. Now when you run Stardew Valley from Steam it should automatically launch StardewModdingAPI.

Stardew Valley is now setup to install mods

# Mod List

Mod description:
>I create mods for love interests and villagers Portrait

This Mod changes the characters portraits into an anime art style! There is two download options being **Portrait Anime Mods OhoDavi 1.5** and **Oho Davi Portrait xnb 1.5**
If you download the xnb version you will be required to interminably change you game files. This is fine if you know you'll never go back to the original files. Otherwise just take the mods folder, unzip it and put it into your mods folder.

# Seasonal Outfits - Slightly Cuter Aesthetic
**Requires Content Patcher**
>Overhauls all character sprites and portraits for a slightly cuter aesthetic

What we want from this mod is the seasonal sprites it provides rather than the change in the portraits in the original art style of the game. Along with the 4 seasons it gives different outfits for different events.
Go into the (CP) Seasonal Cute Characters folder, open up assets, and then delete the portraits folder.
### Optional
This mod also has a multiplayer and swimsuit file versions that you can add with the Seasonal Cute Characters mod. 
The multiplayer mod is an experimental fix for winter outfits not loading in multiplayer.

### Optional
*This mod also has other versions that you might need/want to use.*
#### Seasonal Cute Characters - Multiplayer
>Experimental mod for multiplayer not loading winter outfits. The trade off is that there won't be indoor/outdoor sprites in winter. If you still have problems, try setting "FestivalOutfits" and "ExtraOutfits" to false. Install instead of the main mod.
#### Seasonal Cute Characters - Swimwear
>This adds back the swimwear that was removed from the main mod because it wasn't compatible with pants and skirts mods. Do not install with Json Asset pants or skirts or there will be visual glitches!!! You still need to configure "nonose" in this file.
#### Tight pants to long pants
>Tight pants (pants 10) are visually glitchy because of the wider legs of the new farmer bases. I replaced them with longer pants. Characters can now wear half-shoes ("warmweather") and have a set of long pants (see last two pictures for more info).

#  (CP) Seasonal Anime Portraits III
**Requires Content Patcher**
Mod Description:
>An updated Seasonal Anime Portraits is finally here and working with its own Script!
>
>Seasonal Anime Portraits III is a [CP] standalone scripted mod that gives Villager a different **portrait** outfit each season.  
All M/F Marriable characters currently included more to come!
